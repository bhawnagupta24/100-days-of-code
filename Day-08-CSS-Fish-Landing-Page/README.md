# Day 8 – CSS Fish Landing Page 🌊🐟

In this project, I created a visually rich landing page inspired by ocean life.
The focus was on layout design, typography, background images, and overlay effects
using pure HTML and CSS.

## What I Learned

- Structuring a landing page using semantic HTML
- Using background images with overlays
- Applying CSS positioning (absolute & relative)
- Styling navigation menus with buttons
- Working with typography, spacing, and letter-spacing
- Creating visually appealing UI using minimal elements

## Files Included

- fish-landing-page.html
- fish-landing-page.css

## Preview Idea

A dark themed ocean background with elegant typography showcasing
the beauty of marine life.
