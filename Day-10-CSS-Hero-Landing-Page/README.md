# Day 10 – CSS Hero Landing Page

In this project, I built a responsive hero landing page using HTML and CSS.  
The focus was on layout structuring, background images, navigation bar design,
and brand logo alignment.

## What I Learned

- Creating a navigation bar using Flexbox
- Structuring a hero section with background images
- Using absolute positioning for images
- Improving UI using spacing, fonts, and buttons
- Managing assets like images and logos properly
- Writing clean and reusable CSS

## Files Included

- project1.html – Main HTML structure
- project1.css – Styling using CSS
- image.png – Hero background image
- logo folder – Brand logos used in the project

## Preview

This landing page contains:
- Navigation bar with links and buttons
- Hero section with heading, paragraph, CTA button
- Second section with partner brand logos
