# Day 9 – CSS Motivation Section

In this project, I created a motivational landing section using HTML and CSS.
The design focuses on background images, overlay effects, centered content,
and clean typography.

## What I Learned
- Creating full-screen layouts using height and width
- Using background images with cover and center properties
- Applying overlay using rgba colors
- Centering content using absolute positioning and transform
- Styling text with spacing, fonts, and colors
- Designing buttons with borders and transparency

## Files Included
- learn.html – HTML structure for the motivation section
- learn.css – CSS styling including background image and overlay

centered text, and a call-to-action button.
