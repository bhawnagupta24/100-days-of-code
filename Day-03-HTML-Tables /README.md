# Day 3 – HTML Tables (rowspan & colspan)

In this project, I practiced creating HTML tables and learned how to structure complex tables using rowspan and colspan attributes.

## What I Learned

- Difference between table headers and table data
- How to merge rows using `rowspan`
- How to merge columns using `colspan`
- Creating real-world style tables (schedule, family data, compatibility tables)

## Files Included
- `table.html` – Basic table practice with multiple rows and columns
- `rcspan.html` – Table using `rowspan` and `colspan` (seminar schedule)
- `classwork.html` – Practice tables created during class
